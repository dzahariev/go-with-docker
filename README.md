# go-with-docker
Sample repo for CI with docker using multistage builds. 
The Dockerfile example shows how to execute unit tests for different packages in parallel with the [BuildKit](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/build_enhancements/) engine.

## Preconditions

Installations:

- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## Details

Execution steps are:
 - Stage: `build` - execute build to ensure that binary can be prodiced from sources
 - Stage: `test-prepare` - prepares the tests environment by fetching all required go libraries in separate layer
 - Stage: `test-main`, `test-pckg01`, `test-pckg02` - execute the tests for each one of the packages
 - Stage: `join` - joins the build results by copying a dummy files that were created as result of each test stage
 - Stage: `release` - prepare image from scratch that contain only binary file that was produced from `build` stage.

To start the tests with BuildKit enabled:
```
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build . --no-cache
```
Result shows the steps:
